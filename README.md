## DocVQA Scripts

The repository contains some of my helper functions for finetuning unimodal / multimodal models for the task for Visual Question Answering. I would be adding the code, how how I did use these stuffs soon, but for now, maybe you can just explore the stuffs from this repo, or the reference repo (I guess it is a bit old, and contain the code for tensorflow, so I had to modify the code for pytorch)
